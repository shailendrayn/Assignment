1. Voting app was clone by using  https://github.com/ashishrpandey/example-voting-app
2. since working I am on working node for practice session ports changed as :  vote service : 31002 , result serviec : 31003 
3. Deleted existing pods as below

[root@ip-172-31-0-196 k8s-specifications]# kubectl delete all --all;
pod "db-b54cd94f4-9qc47" deleted
pod "kubia-0" deleted
pod "kubia-1" deleted

4. voting app pods created as below:
[root@ip-172-31-0-196 k8s-specifications]# kubectl apply -f .

deployment.apps/db created
service/db created
deployment.apps/redis created
service/redis created
deployment.apps/result created
service/result created
deployment.apps/vote created
service/vote created
deployment.apps/worker created

Votting app>>redis>>worker>>db>>result app

redis is used for queing.

5. Check status of all pods/service/deployement/replicaset as below:
[root@ip-172-31-0-196 k8s-specifications]#  kubectl get all
NAME                          READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
pod/db-b54cd94f4-p8cpl        1/1     Running   0          25s
pod/redis-868d64d78-zqz7t     1/1     Running   0          25s

NAME                 TYPE        CLUSTER-IP       EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)          AGE
service/db           ClusterIP   10.102.142.227   <none>        5432/TCP         25s
service/kubernetes   ClusterIP   10.96.0.1        <none>        443/TCP          6m49s

deployment.apps/redis    1/1     1            1           25s


NAME                                DESIRED   CURRENT   READY   AGE
replicaset.apps/db-b54cd94f4        1         1         1       17m
replicaset.apps/redis-868d64d78     1         1         1       17m


6. now url is 
for voting : http://13.251.103.213:31002/
for result : http://13.251.103.213:31003/

7. In voting page we can cast the vote and result can be seen in result page 

OBSERVATIONS:
> Voting page shows which container is processing the application
> We can change the voting choise
> result page shows the result and if the choise is changed in voting page result page changes the result.

8.Delete the voting app
[root@ip-172-31-0-196 ~]# kubectl delete po vote-94849dc97-68rh5
pod "vote-94849dc97-68rh5" deleted

OBSERVATIONS:
> On web page there is no affect as we can still cast the vote and see the result changed.

> On checking the pod status we can observer that old voting pod is deleted and new voting pod is created.

[root@ip-172-31-0-196 ~]# kubectl get po
NAME                      READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
db-b54cd94f4-p8cpl        1/1     Running   0          58m
redis-868d64d78-zqz7t     1/1     Running   0          58m
result-5d57b59f4b-zrjz8   1/1     Running   0          58m
vote-94849dc97-9cmbh      1/1     Running   0          16s
worker-dd46d7584-2mvlj    1/1     Running   0          18m


9. Delete worker pod
[root@ip-172-31-0-196 ~]# kubectl delete po worker-dd46d7584-qpqkf
pod "worker-dd46d7584-qpqkf" deleted


OBSERVATIONS:
> On web page there is no affect as we can still cast the vote and see the result changed.

> On checking the pod status we can observer that old worker pod is deleted and new worker pod is created.
  There can only affect for few microseconds , that too can be avoided by creating multiple worker pods by scaling.
  This is how Kubernetes opts for RESILIENCY over ROBUSTNESS.

[root@ip-172-31-0-196 ~]# kubectl get all
NAME                          READY   STATUS              RESTARTS   AGE
pod/db-b54cd94f4-p8cpl        1/1     Running             0          39m
pod/redis-868d64d78-zqz7t     1/1     Running             0          39m
pod/result-5d57b59f4b-zrjz8   1/1     Running             0          39m
pod/vote-94849dc97-68rh5      1/1     Running             0          39m
pod/worker-dd46d7584-2mvlj    0/1     ContainerCreating   0          9s
pod/worker-dd46d7584-qpqkf    1/1     Terminating         0          39m

10. Delete the db pod

[root@ip-172-31-0-196 ~]# kubectl delete po db-b54cd94f4-p8cpl
pod "db-b54cd94f4-p8cpl" deleted

OBSERVATIONS:
> On web page we an still cast vote in voting page but the result page is not updated.

> On check pod status we see that db pod has recreated.
  Also the worker pod has taken reset on its container.


[root@ip-172-31-0-196 ~]# kubectl get po
NAME                      READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
db-b54cd94f4-xsbm7        1/1     Running   0          74s
redis-868d64d78-zqz7t     1/1     Running   0          67m
result-5d57b59f4b-zrjz8   1/1     Running   0          67m
vote-94849dc97-9cmbh      1/1     Running   0          10m
worker-dd46d7584-2mvlj    1/1     Running   1          28m

This is becuase the socker connection is disconnected between the old db pod and result pod.
This can be checked by checking the logs for the result pod.

[root@ip-172-31-0-196 ~]#  kubectl logs result-5d57b59f4b-zrjz8

11. Recovering the result pod

The vote pod and db pod socket connection was also disconnected but the voting pod took a restart on container and recoverd itself
so we were able to cast the vote.

But the result pod failed to take restart as it was not programed in that way.
So we give manual restart to result pods by deleting it.

[root@ip-172-31-0-196 ~]# kubectl delete po result-5d57b59f4b-zrjz8
pod "result-5d57b59f4b-zrjz8" deleted

NAME                      READY   STATUS        RESTARTS   AGE
